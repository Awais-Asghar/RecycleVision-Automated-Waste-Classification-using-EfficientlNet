# RecycleVision-Automated-Waste-Classification-using-EfficientlNet
Recycling fails when different types of waste get mixed together. Manual sorting is slow and unhygienic, so a smart automated system is needed. RecycleVision is a deep learning based image classifier that identifies different types of waste and makes automatic segregation possible for smart bins and recycling plants.
